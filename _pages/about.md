<!-- Hi there!!👋 I am Zhiyuan Xu, a sophomore student majoring in Computer Science at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). Currently, I am exploring my research interests in computer networks and artificial intelligence. I am a research assistant at [Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC, CAS)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://cnic.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202309/t20230919_6890324.html) and [Prof. Xinyi Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088445633).

Hi there!!👋 I'm Zhiyuan Xu, a junior student majoring in Computer Science at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interests primarily lie in computer vision-related area, where I'm actively exploring and delving deeper. Currently, I am a research intern at [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University](https://www.discover-lab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Hao Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/fromandto). Before that, I contributed as a research intern at [Visual Information Processing and Learning group (VIPL), ICT, CAS](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/), where I was fortunate to learn and explore under the guidance of [Prof. Shuang Yang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/syang/).

During my freshman year and sophomore year, I also explored the area of computer networks, by working as a research assistant at [Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC, CAS)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://cnic.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202309/t20230919_6890324.html) and [Prof. Xinyi Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088445633). 

Prior to my research journey, I developed a strong interest in competitive programming and computer science during my (junior) high school years. I have participated in various programming contests, such as National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP), and am an active participant in International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) currently.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
