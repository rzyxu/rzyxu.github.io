<!-- Hi there!!👋 I am Zhiyuan Xu, a sophomore student majoring in Computer Science at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). Currently, I am exploring my research interests in computer networks and artificial intelligence. I am a research assistant at [Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC, CAS)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://cnic.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202309/t20230919_6890324.html) and [Prof. Xinyi Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088445633). I am also a research intern at [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Shuang Yang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/syang/). -->

Hi there!!👋 I'm Zhiyuan Xu, a junior student majoring in Computer Science at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interests lie in computer vision and computer networks, where I'm actively exploring and delving deeper. Currently, I am a research intern at [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Research1/DISCOVER_Laboratory.htm), supervised by [Prof. Hao Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/fromandto).

During my freshman year and sophomore year, I worked as a research assistant at [Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC, CAS)](http://www.cnic.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://cnic.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202309/t20230919_6890324.html) and [Prof. Xinyi Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088445633). Additionally, I also contributed as a research intern at [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Shuang Yang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/syang/).

Before that, I developed a strong interest in competitive programming and computer science during my (junior) high school years. I have participated in various programming contests, such as National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP), and am an active participant in International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) currently.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
